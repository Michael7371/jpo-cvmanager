# CV Manager Cloud Run Application

The CV Manager Cloud Run Application is a single application alternative to running all of the separate cloud functions as individual micro services. The Cloud Run function is triggered over HTTP just like a cloud function and performs all of the same features with optimized authentication and communication with the RSU REST API.

### Benefits:

- Reduces network hops when making calls to RSUs to 2 hops instead of 5
- Authentication and role assignment is integrated into a middleware script in the REST API
- Less technical overhead (Less duplicated code across functions and less deployments)

## Middleware

Before the Cloud Run CV Manager will allow an endpoint to be hit, the middleware function will run to first authorize the user credentials. This makes it so that the user must always be authorized to be able to run the cloud run endpoints with no exceptions. (Besides HTTP OPTIONS methods for CORS support)

The middleware makes the following assumptions:

- Users are unique based on their email
- Users are only assigned a single role

## Supported Endpoints

Expected headers for all endpoints:

- `"Content-Type": "application/json"`
- `"Authorization": "tokenId"`

### <b>/rsu-google-auth</b> <b>(GET)</b>

Returns authorized user information including full name, email, and role.

Example return value:

- {"name": "John Doe", "email": "jdoe@gmail.com", "role": "admin"}

### <b>/rsuinfo</b> <b>(GET)</b>

Returns all basic data for RSUs in the GCP Cloud SQL database. It performs a basic select all query from a table named "RsuData" that is located in a database specified by the environments variables. Returns single JSON object.

### <b>/rsu-online-status</b> <b>(GET)</b>

Returns the online status of every RSU and the last time each RSU has been documented to be online in a single JSON object.

### <b>/rsucounts</b> <b>(GET)</b>

Returns the message counts for a single, selected RSU from a BigQuery table. It performs a basic select query on a table specified by the environments variable. Returns single JSON object.

### <b>/rsu-command</b> <b>(GET, POST)</b>

### <b>/rsu-map-info</b> <b>(GET)</b>

Returns the list of all ipv4 addresses with MAP message data in the PostgreSQL database when argument ip_list is true. Returns the MAP message geoJSON data for the RSU specified in the ip_address argument as a single JSON object when ip_list is false.

### <b>/rsu-bsm-data</b> <b>(POST)</b>

Returns geoJSON data for BSM messages from a BigQuery table given start time, end time, and geofence coordinates. It performs a select query on a table specified by the BSM_DB_NAME environment variable. Returns an array of JSON objects.

1. Verifies the command and calls the corresponding function.
2. Provided RSU data is plugged into the appropriate data structure depending upon the RSU REST endpoint.
   - HTTP GET URL arguments
   - HTTP POST body data
3. Directly hit RSUs with SNMP commands or trigger the RSU REST endpoint for SSH commands.
4. Return response, varies depending upon request.

## Admin Endpoints

The CV Manager supports users who are application admins (super users) to add new RSUs, users and organizations to the CV Manager. This will then effect the database so it will be viewable to all users in the chosen organizations.

## RSUs

### <b>/admin-new-rsu</b> <b>(GET)</b>

Returns the field options for specific RSU fields that do not take free-form responses.

- primary_routes (will still allow new route names)

- ssh_credential_groups
- snmp_credential_groups
- organizations

### <b>/admin-new-rsu</b> <b>(POST)</b>

## Deploying CV Manager Cloud Run REST API

1. Build docker image, tag it and push it to a GCP image repository (Container Registry)
   - `cd ~/RSU_Management/GCP_cloud_run/rsu_manager` (~ represents wherever you cloned the repository within your local machine)
   - `docker build .`
   - `docker image tag <image-id> <image-name>:<tag>`
   - `docker push <image-name>:<tag>`
2. Go to GCP Cloud Run and click "Create Service"
3. Configure the Cloud Run deployment container settings
   - Select container image (the one from step 1)
   - Set container port to 8080
   - CPU allocation setting is up to the user
   - 512MB is enough memory to run the application
4. Configure the Cloud Run deployment variables and secrets settings
   - The following environment variables are required to be set by environment variable or secret:

<b>Environment Variables:</b>

- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: The OAuth 2.0 Google Client ID provided by GCP when the credentials are created. It is recommended to attach this via a secret.
- INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME: The connection name for the Cloud SQL instance. (project-id:region:name)
- DB_NAME: The database name.
- DB_USER: The database user that will be used to authenticate the cloud function when it queries the database.
- DB_PASS: The database user's password that will be used to authenticate the cloud function.
- COUNT_DB_NAME: The BigQuery table name where the RSU message counts are located.
- RSU_REST_ENDPOINT: HTTPS endpoint of the deployed RSU REST API in GCP Kubernetes.
- LOGGING_LEVEL: The level of which the application will log. (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- BSM_DB_NAME: The database name for BSM visualization data.

5. Configure the Cloud Run deployment connections settings
   - The application assumes there is a Cloud SQL DB, select the DB under "Cloud SQL connections". Ensure the environment variables match the selected DB.
   - The application makes requests to the automated RSU REST API located in K8s. If this is in a VPC, configure the proper VPC connector. Route only requests to private IPs.
6. Configure the Cloud Run deployment security settings
   - Ensure a service account has been selected that has:
     - Cloud SQL Client permissions
     - VPC Connector permissions
     - BigQuery access permissions
7. Deploy and utilize the assigned endpoint in the CV Manager React application's environment variables
